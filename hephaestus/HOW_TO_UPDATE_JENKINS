How to update Jenkins?
---

1) bump the version of the Jenkins image to the most recent available -lts version
2) using the build-next.sh to modify the Dockerfile
3) build the new image (as root)

# podman build . -t hephaestus.next

4) Delete the content (if any) of the 'next/' folder.

5) start the associated service

# systemctl start hephaestus.next

Check that the service has successfully started and then log into /jenkins.next and double check the new service does use the new image. 

If everything looks good, shutdown jenkins.next, clean the next/ folder, commit the version upgrade in ares and then update the hephaestus image, before restarting the associated service.
